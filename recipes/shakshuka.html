            <h3 class="slogan">Hearty, Spiced Shakshuka with Poached Eggs</h3>
            <p class="intro uno">Shakshuka is a vibrant and comforting dish of eggs poached in a rich, spiced tomato and pepper sauce. Originating from North Africa and widely embraced across the Middle East, 
                it’s both simple and deeply flavorful—thanks to ingredients like garlic, cumin, paprika, and simmered tomatoes. The eggs cook gently in the sauce until the whites are set but 
                the yolks remain perfectly runny, ready to be scooped up with warm bread.
            </p>

            <p class="intro dos"> This one-pan meal is as nourishing as it is beautiful, ideal for breakfast, brunch, or a light dinner. It’s easy to make with pantry staples and can be customized with extras like feta cheese, 
                chili flakes, or fresh herbs. Shakshuka is more than just eggs in tomato sauce—it’s a bold, soulful dish that brings people together around the table, no matter the time of day.

            <h2 class="red ss">Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="red ss">Sauté the vegetables:</span>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5–7 minutes until softened.</li>
                <li><span class="red ss">Add garlic and spices:</span> Stir in the garlic, cumin, paprika, and chili flakes (if using). Cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
                <li><span class="red ss">Simmer the sauce:</span> Add the diced tomatoes (with their juices) and season with salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
                <li><span class="red ss">Add the eggs:</span> Use a spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack an egg into each one. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 5–8 minutes, until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny (or to your preferred doneness).</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and sprinkle with chopped parsley or cilantro. Add any optional toppings, then serve hot, straight from the pan, with warm bread for dipping.</li>
            </ol>

                <h2 class="green pwc">Steps: </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="green pwc">Cook the pasta:</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions until cooked. Reserve about ½ cup of the pasta water, then drain and set pasta aside.</li>
                    <li><span class="green pwc">Cook the chicken:</span> While the pasta cooks, season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 5–7 minutes, or until golden and fully cooked through. Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li><span class="green pwc">Combine pasta and pesto:</span> Return the drained pasta to the pot or a large pan. Add the pesto and stir gently to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, stir in a tablespoon or two of reserved pasta water to loosen it.</li>
                    <li><span class="green pwc">Add chicken and cheese:</span> Stir in the cooked chicken and Parmesan cheese. Mix until everything is well combined and heated through.</li>
                    <li>Divide among plates or bowls and top with extra Parmesan, fresh basil, or a drizzle of olive oil if desired. Optional: Garnish with cherry tomatoes or a handful of fresh baby spinach for extra color and flavor.</li>

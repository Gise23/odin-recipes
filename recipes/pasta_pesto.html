            <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>340g pasta </li>
                <li>1-2 tablespoons pasta cooking water</li>
                <li>2  boneless, skinless chicken breasts (sliced or cubed)</li>
                <li>2  tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1  cup basil pesto</li>
                <li>¼  cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
               
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cook the pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions until cooked. Reserve about ½ cup of the pasta water, then drain and set pasta aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> While the pasta cooks, season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 5–7 minutes, or until golden and fully cooked through. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine pasta and pesto:</strong> Return the drained pasta to the pot or a large pan. Add the pesto and stir gently to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, stir in a tablespoon or two of reserved pasta water to loosen it.</li>
                <li><strong>Add chicken and cheese:</strong> Stir in the cooked chicken and Parmesan cheese. Mix until everything is well combined and heated through.</li>
                <li>Divide among plates or bowls and top with extra Parmesan, fresh basil, or a drizzle of olive oil if desired. Optional: Garnish with cherry tomatoes or a handful of fresh baby spinach for extra color and flavor.</li>
            </ol>

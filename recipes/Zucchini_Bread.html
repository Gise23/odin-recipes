                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 spoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 cups grated zucchini</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C).</strong> Grease and flour two 8x4-inch loaf pans or line them with parchment paper.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and ground cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Beat wet ingredients:</strong> In another large bowl, beat the eggs until light and frothy. Add the vegetable oil, sugar, and vanilla extract, and mix well until fully combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine wet and dry:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring just until incorporated. <em>Do not over-mix.</em></li>
                <li>Gently stir in the grated zucchini and chopped walnuts until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
                <li>Pour into pans: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared loaf pans and smooth the tops.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Allow the loaves to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>

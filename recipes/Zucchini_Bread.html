            <h2 class="orange">Steps: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="orange">Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C).</span> Grease and flour two 8x4-inch loaf pans or line them with parchment paper.</li>
                <li><span class="orange">Mix dry ingredients:</span> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and ground cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
                <li><span class="orange">Beat wet ingredients:</span> In another large bowl, beat the eggs until light and frothy. Add the vegetable oil, sugar, and vanilla extract, and mix well until fully combined.</li>
                <li><span class="orange">Combine wet and dry:</span> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring just until incorporated. <em>Do not over-mix.</em></li>
                <li>Gently stir in the grated zucchini and chopped walnuts until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
                <li>Pour into pans: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared loaf pans and smooth the tops.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Allow the loaves to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
